    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>In Vainglory, there are multiple objectives you can capture to help your team. For the first 4 minutes, theres a center ent that when killed gives you more gold and heals than an average ent. After 4 minutes, a Gold Miner will spawn that will gradually farm gold and when killed will grant the team that killed it all the gold it has stroed up. The final objective spawns at 15 minutes and is called the Kraken. When killed, it'll help the team that killed it by walking to the opponents base.</p>
    <p>In Vainglory one f the only ways to win is to stick together as a team and outplay the opposiing team. If the entire opposing team dies before someone respawnes, your team willg et an Ace. Aces heals your entire team and slightly boosts their speed for a small amount of time. Your minions also become buffed and can help take out turrets more efficiently.
